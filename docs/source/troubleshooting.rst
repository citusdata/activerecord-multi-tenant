Troubleshooting
===============

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter when using ``activerecord-multi-tenant``.

Common Issues and Their Solutions
---------------------------------

**Issue:** Tenant scope is not applied to queries.

**Solution:** Make sure you've set the current tenant before executing queries. Use the MultiTenant.with method to set the current tenant. For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

    MultiTenant.with(customer) do
      site = Site.find(params[:site_id])
      site.update! last_accessed_at: Time.now
      site.page_views.count
    end



FAQs and Known Limitations
--------------------------

**Q: Can I use multiple tenant models in the same application?**

**A:** Yes, you can declare different tenant models in different ActiveRecord models. However, you can only set one current tenant at a time.

**Q: Does ``activerecord-multi-tenant`` support Rails version 5.X?**

**A:** ``activerecord-multi-tenant`` supports Rails 6.1.0 and later. For older versions of Rails, please use the appropriate version of the gem.
