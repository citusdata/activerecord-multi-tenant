* Fix statement cache for has_many through relations [#103](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/103)


## 1.1.0      2020-08-06

* See commits for changes:
  https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/commits/v1.1.0


## 1.0.4      2019-10-30

* Fix bug introduced in 1.0.3 for delete when table is reference or not distributed


## 1.0.3      2019-10-28

* Ensure that when using object.delete, we set the tenant


## 1.0.2      2019-09-20

* Compatibility  with rails 6
* Remove support for rails 4.0  and  4.1
* Fix bug when multiple databases are used


## 1.0.1      2019-08-27

* Ensure current tenant is present before adding tenant id filter in DatabaseStatements


## 1.0.0      2019-07-05

* Fix `RETURNING id` for distributed tables with no primary key
* Include fix for partial select described in issue [#34](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/issues/34).
  - When doing a partial select without the tenant like `Project.select(:name).find(project.id)` it would raise `ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError (missing attribute: tenant_id)`


## 0.11.0      2019-06-12

* Fix queries with joins by including the tenant column when current tenant isn't set
  - A common use case is having a filter on the tenant, but `MultiTenant.with` isn't used like `Project.where(account_id: 1).eager_load(:categories)`. This version fixes the ORM call to include in the `join`: `"project_categories"."account_id" = "projects"."account_id"`


## 0.10.0      2019-05-31

* Add `MultiTenant.without` to remove already set tenant context in a block [#45](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/45) [Jackson Miller](https://github.com/jaxn)
* Fix uninitialized constant X::ActiveRecord::VERSION [#42](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/42) [vollnhals](https://github.com/vollnhals)
* Fix find and find_by caching issues
  - This builds on work by multiple contributors, and fixes issues where the
    tenant_id would be cached across different tenant contexts for find
    and find_by methods. This issue was only present with prepared
    statements turned on
  -  Note that the mechanism to solve this is slightly different for Rails 4
    and 5:
    - Rails 4: Disable any caching for find and find_by methods
    - Rails 5: Explicitly add the current_tenant_id into the cache key
  - This also ensures that we test both prepared statements on and off
    on Travis
* Added method to ensure that the current tenant is loaded [#49](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/49) [Stephen Bussey](https://github.com/sb8244)
  - This is ideal for fully utilizing the ActiveRecord extensions, as they only take effect when the
    current tenant is not an ID
* Update loofah and rack to fix security warnings
  - Note that loofah is not a direct dependency of the libary, so this only
    applies when running the test suite
* Remove monkey patch that previously disabled referential integrity (DISABLE/ENABLE TRIGGER ALL) [#53](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/53) [RÃ©mi Piotaix](https://github.com/piotaixr)
  - This was required for Citus compatibility, but the issue has been fixed in
    Citus for over a year (https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues/1080)


## 0.9.0       2018-06-22

* ActiveRecord 5.2 support [Nathan Stitt](https://github.com/nathanstitt) & [osyo-manga](https://github.com/osyo-manga)


## 0.8.1       2017-10-06

    for (re-)writing this code and verifying it works well
  * This fixes caching issues across multiple MultiTenant.with { } blocks when
    interacting with the Rails statement cache
* Drop support for Rails 3.2
  * The arel version used in Rails 3.2 has caused more trouble than its worth -

    least Rails 4.0

  * Use table name to model klass registry
* Improve tests for activerecord-multi-tenant
  * Use lower shard count to speed up tests
  * Drop database cleaner dependency


## 0.5.0       2017-05-08

* Write-only mode that enables step-by-step migrations

* Support passing ID values to MultiTenant.with directly [@webandtech](https://github.com/webandtech) [#6](https://github.com/citusdata/activerecord-multi-tenant/pull/6)
  * This effectively deprecates with_id, but we'll keep it around for now
* Remove unnecessary validation for invalid belongs_to association


## 0.3.4       2017-02-22

* Expand with_lock workaround to cover lock! as well
* Enable trigger workaround on Rails 5 as well, otherwise it fails silently
